VMD Diffusion Coefficient Tool

The Diffusion Coefficient Tool is an analysis plugin for VMD that
computes one, two or three-dimensional MSD-based diffusion
coefficients of a chosen molecular species.

This is alpha software. If you don't know how to compute the diffusion
coefficient yourself, probably you won't be able to use this
software. NO support or warranty is available whatsoever.

Repeat. The Diffusion Coefficient Tool is not a magic box. It only
computes mean squared displacements at a variety of lag times (τ). The
MSD is predicted by Einstein's relation to grow linearly with τ. Most
often than not, this DOES NOT occur in practice, for a variety of
reasons, including poor sampling or non-diffusive behavior. It is YOUR
responsibility to understand why and, if you trust the linearity, to
fit the slope.


Important: please check the current version of software and 
documentation at its home-page:
