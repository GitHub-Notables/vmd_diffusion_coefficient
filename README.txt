VMD Diffusion Coefficient Tool
----------------------------------------

The Diffusion Coefficient Tool is an analysis plugin for VMD that
computes one, two or three-dimensional MSD-based diffusion
coefficients of a chosen molecular species.

This is experimental software. If you don't know how to compute the
diffusion coefficient yourself, probably you won't be able to use this
software. NO support or warranty is available whatsoever.

Important: please check the current version of software and 
documentation at its home-page:
